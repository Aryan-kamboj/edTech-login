No, you should not use the = operator to directly assign the state object to a new variable. Assigning the state object to a new variable using = will create a new reference, but it will still refer to the same state object in memory. Modifying the new variable will also modify the original state object, leading to unexpected behavior.

Here's an example to illustrate this:

jsx
Copy code
const prevState = { prop: true };
const newState = prevState;

newState.prop = false;

console.log(prevState.prop); // Output: false
In this example, modifying the newState object also modifies the prevState object because they both reference the same object in memory.

To ensure a separate object with independent references, you should use the spread operator (...) or other methods like Object.assign() or a deep cloning library like lodash.cloneDeep().

Using the spread operator in the functional form of the state update function is a commonly used approach in React for updating state properties with separate references.

Here's an example of using the spread operator to update state properties:

toggle_hide((prevState) => {
  return {
    ...prevState,
    [event.currentTarget.id]: !prevState[event.currentTarget.id]
  };
});
In this example, the spread operator is used to create a new object with separate references by spreading the properties of the previous state object (prevState). Then, the specific property is modified by using computed property names ([event.currentTarget.id]) and assigned a new value.

Using the spread operator in this way ensures that the updated state is a new object with separate references, avoiding unintended side effects.
